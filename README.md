## 📌 Project Purpose

This project was created as a **foundation-level JavaScript project** to strengthen hands-on understanding of core concepts such as:

- Working with REST APIs
- Handling asynchronous operations using `async/await`
- Parsing and formatting data (dates, time, units)
- Updating the DOM dynamically based on API responses
- Writing clean, readable, and maintainable JavaScript

The focus of this project is on **learning fundamentals without using any frameworks**, making it easier to understand what happens behind the scenes.
